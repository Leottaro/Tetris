# Tetris
My first Tetris game coded with Java

You can press:
LEFT : go left
RIGHT : go right
DOWN or S : to speed up the fall
UP or X : rotate clockwise
Control or Command : rotate anti clockwise
SHIFT or C : to hold a piece
SPACE or ENTER : hard drop your piece
ESCAPE : pause the game
R : restart when you're i the pause menu

Clearing multiple lines give way more score.
The game increase your level (and your speed) every 10 lines you cleared.
The higher your level is, the faster your score will increase.

There is a saving of your best score on both local and a server that sync each other.
the games itself is separate from its display so you can do what you want with it easily.
I optimized the game as i could, feel free to tell me what i could have done better.
