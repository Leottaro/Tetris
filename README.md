# Tetris

- SPACE or ENTER : hard drop your piece

- R : restart when you're in the pause menu

### Information:
Clearing multiple lines give way more score. <br>
The game increase your level (and your speed) every 10 lines you cleared. <br>
The higher your level is, the faster your score will increase. <br>
<br>
There is a saving of your best score on both local and a server that sync each other. <br>
the games itself is separate from its display so you can do what you want with it easily. <br>
I optimized the game as i could, feel free to tell me what i could have done better. <br>
